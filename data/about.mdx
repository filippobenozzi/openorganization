<div className="prose dark:prose-dark">
I'm Filippo Benozzi a developer, economic student and musician. I currently live in the countryside near Venice, Italy.

I'm currently working in a web-agency near my town as a front-end developer, I'm also moving my first steps as an entrepreneur in my parents fashion company [ErreBi](https://errebi.it).<br/>
As a side project I'm developing a booking system platform used by [Always Growing](https://booking.alwaysgrowing.co.uk).

I'm enrolled in a Master Degree in [Global Development and Entrepreneurship](https://www.unive.it/pag/24754/) at University of Venice and I already achieve a Computer Science bachelor degree at University of Trento.

I decided to open this website as my personal space. I will share my snippets, projects and experiences of the things that I'm working or studying on.

If you want to share with me suggestions, opinion or new ideas, please reach me at [me@filippo.im](mailto:me@filippo.im).

Ciao!
