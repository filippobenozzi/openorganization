Backup of a computer system is very important as it can prevent you from data loss in case of system failure. [Duplicacy](https://duplicacy.com/) is an open-source data backup tool that provides encrypted, digitally signed, and versioned local or remote backup of files.

I used Duplicacy everywhere (*even on my Synology*) for backup my data to a Google Team Drive as It's super easy to configure and super cheap (*20$ first year purchase and 5$ for renew each year*), also is fully configurable with Google Shared Team Drive and S3 compatible server (*Minio in my case*).

In this article, I will discuss how to install and use Duplicacy in Ubuntu/Debian and backup on a Google Shared Team Drive.

## Features of Duplicacy

The key features of Duplicacy data backup software are:
- Relatively easy to automate backup
- Web interface for easy configuration
- Encrypts and compresses your backups by default
- Takes incremental backups
- Allows incremental restoration from backups
- Supports multiple different protocols
- It can self-heal if a backup goes wrong
- Supports a lot of destination as well as AWS S3 or compatible, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. (*see [here](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy#storages) all the available destinations*)

*The full list of feature are available on their website [here](https://duplicacy.com/).*

## How to install Duplicacy Web on Ubuntu/Debian

Use the following command to download the latest version of the package (*copy the link of the package from [here](https://duplicacy.com/download.html) based on your linux installation*):

```bash
mkdir ~/duplicacy
wget -O ~/duplicacy/duplicacy [link from above]
```

Next give to your downloaded executable file the following permissions:

```bash
chmod +x ~/duplicacy/duplicacy
```

Now Duplicacy is ready to be used, follow the next step if you want to know how to run it as system service and access it from the web.

## How to auto-run Duplicacy as a system service

Using these steps you will be able to run Duplicacy as a system service, and then access it from the web using the IP address of your machine.

First, run the following command to create the service in the right directory:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/duplicacy.service
```

Then past inside the following content, be sure to specify your local user and the directory where the Duplicacy executable is located (*I used the root user for this tutorial, but I highly suggest you to change it*):

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Duplicacy Backup

Wants=network.target
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/root/duplicacy/duplicacy
WorkingDirectory=/root/.duplicacy-web/
User=root
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then we need to be able to access Duplicacy from the internet, so we need to add the following pre-config file in our user directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/duplicacy-web
nano ~/.duplicacy-web/settings.json
```

Then paste the following content:

```bash
{
    "listening_address": "0.0.0.0:3875"
} 
```

Then we can run the service using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable duplicacy
sudo systemctl start duplicacy
```

You should be able to reach you Duplicacy web interface using machine your IP address, followed by the port *3875*.
